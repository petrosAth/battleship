# About

This is an impletentation of the classic game 'Battleship'. The main objective
of this app is to get familiar with Test Driven Development, TDD for short.
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software
requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed,
and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against
all test cases.<sup>1</sup>.
